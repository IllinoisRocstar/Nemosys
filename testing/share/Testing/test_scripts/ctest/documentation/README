Files in this folder define documentation build paths. To enable automatic documentation build and install, place a file in 
this directory with the project name. It will be automatically parsed by the build system if build_documentation is set in 
the automated test configuration file.

There are two modes of operation, first the documentation can be installed somewhere on a local filesystem. This is most common 
for internal projects. The system also has the capability to publish documentation to github in a named branch. For this capability
to work, the project tested should already be hosted on git.

Options should be 

<destination>|<path>|<doc_src>

<destination> is either local or git
<path> is either a local path accessible to the user, or a git branch name (typically gh-pages)
<doc_src> is the directory for the documentation to be copied to.

MAdLib - Benchmarks - moveIt

Description
------------

This benchmark allows to define a motion of the domain boundaries 
and adapt the mesh accordingly. 

How to use it ?
----------------

The parameters of the computations are defined in a file called 
'MyParams.h' which has to be located in this directory and will 
be included during the compilation of the executable. 
You can make a link to the .h file you defined in a subdirectory
for instance.

The 'MyParams.h' file has to be written according to the template 
defined in 'Parameters.h'.

In the 'MyParams.h' file, a target mesh file with a '.msh' 
extension is required. In order to produce it, download Gmsh at 
<http://www.geuz.org/gmsh> and run:

gmsh -3 -optimize 'the_geo_file'

where 'the_geo_file' is a file with a '.geo' extension, the 
native CAD file format of Gmsh.

Once the executable is compiled, run it without any argument. The 
output will be produced and stored according to the parameters 
contained in the 'MyParams.h' file at the time of the compilation.
